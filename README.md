**Summary:** Analysis of a Malware-Traffic-Analysis training PCAP demonstrating a Windows host (10.6.13.133) contacting TAG-124 / KongTuke infrastructure, receiving staged payload(s), and performing internal reconnaissance. This repo contains the technical report, IOCs, timeline, and commands to reproduce the network analysis.

## Quick findings
- Victim: 10.6.13.133
- Notable external IPs/domains: 83.137.149.15 (TLS payload ~33 MB), 104.21.16.1 (HTTP POSTs - windows-msgas.com), 104.16.230.132
- Suspicious SNI: hillcoweb.com, truglomedspa.com
- Likely behavior: TAG-124 / KongTuke TDS used to deliver payloads; post-download internal AD reconnaissance observed.
